About Us

GodXP, founded in 2016, began as a spiritual media company with a mission to fuel a culture of spiritual fitness. Starting as an ecommerce store and podcast, we have grown to produce a diverse range of content, including podcasts, clothing, books, online courses, and social media content. Our journey has been guided by the principle of self-mastery and self-discovery through timeless spiritual teachings, helping individuals master life’s dualities—life and death, love and hate, bliss and pain—to achieve true spiritual fitness.

Over the years, we have expanded our services to include digital marketing support for spiritual organizations, recognizing the need for effective online presence in today’s digital age. Now, as we relaunch GodXP, we are focusing primarily on church web design, while also offering social media management, brand/logo design, ecommerce management, and product/merch design. Our goal is to help churches and spiritual organizations establish and enhance their online presence, enabling them to connect with their communities and spread their message effectively.

At GodXP, we are committed to blending our spiritual values with cutting-edge digital solutions. Our founder, Anthony Polanco, brings a unique blend of creativity and expertise, with a background in music, podcasting, digital marketing, spiritual coaching, and martial arts. This diverse experience inspires our innovative approach to serving the spiritual community.

Join us at GodXP as we continue to evolve and serve churches and spiritual organizations with dedication, excellence, and a deep commitment to spiritual growth.
